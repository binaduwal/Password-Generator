# Password Generator

A React-based password generator that creates secure passwords dynamically. It utilizes:

- **useEffect** to update the password whenever dependencies change.
- **useCallback** to optimize functions and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **useRef** to handle DOM elements efficiently, such as copying the generated password to the clipboard.

## Features:
- Customize password length.
- Include/exclude special characters, numbers, and uppercase/lowercase letters.
- Copy generated password to clipboard with a single click.
- Optimized performance with React hooks.
